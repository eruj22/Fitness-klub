One page website for local business

This project was built to test my design skills and website building skills.
I have started with making a design in Adobe XD. It was more of a sketch than proper design. 
After that I started coding. I have used some tutorials in YouTube to implement new elements that previously I hadn't known how to do.
When I had finished coding I minified pictures and website was sent to a friend for a review.
Website was done after some final iterations for mobile devices.
In the end, I have learned a lot and it was fun doing this project.
